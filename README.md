# Welcome to C.MD

This is an *explosive* mixture of ***ClojureScript, Rx, React/Om, core.async, github CORS api, ace, marked, web workers etc***  ~~crafted~~engineered together to give you the *best* ***gist*** editing tool, ever... well, at least a good try :-)
It's currently an alfa-quality prototype, so do not expect to much.


#### What you can do next:

- log in with your Github credentials*
- should you be logged in:
 - click a `:NEW_G!ST:` to set a name and then `PUSH>>` to create a new gist with whatever content is *here*
 - ...or select a gist from the list to work on it, then `PUSH>>` to save, `>>PULL` to update content from Github.
- use `C.MD` as a beautiful *gist* viewer - just set an url hash to `#<gist-id>;p`, for example: <http://eugenen.github.io/C.MD/#58a15db96ca12b952f8e;p>


***

###### \* Sensitive data will only be sent to Github API servers, of course over *https*. `CMD` will also remember your credentials in `localStorage`, so you will enjoy an *autologin* until you will `LOG^OUT`.
